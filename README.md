# Analyzing and Predicting Petrol Consumption

## Objective
You are tasked with analyzing and predicting petrol consumption using the provided dataset: [Petrol Consumption Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpikr/petrol-consumption). Follow the steps outlined below to complete the assignment.

## Instructions

### 1. Dataset Review and Loading
- Download the dataset from the provided link.
- Load the dataset into a Python environment using pandas.
- Provide a brief overview of the dataset, including the structure, columns, and types of data.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Check for missing or null values in the dataset.
- Handle null values appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal), and provide justification for your chosen method.
- Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis by performing necessary preprocessing steps.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform EDA to understand the relationships and patterns in the dataset.
- Include the following analyses:
  - Descriptive statistics of numerical columns.
  - Distribution of features (use histograms, boxplots, etc.).
- Summarize key insights from your analysis.

### 4. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (use an 80-20 split).
- Train the following models on the dataset:
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Use relevant libraries such as scikit-learn for implementation.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared Score
- Compare the performance of the Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

### 6. Documentation
- Document your code, approach, and findings throughout the process.
- Include comments and explanations in your code to improve readability.

### 7. Conclusion
- Provide a summary of your analysis and model results.
- Suggest possible improvements or extensions to the analysis.

## Submission
- Submit a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file with your code and analysis.
- Include a summary report (maximum 1 page) highlighting your findings and conclusions.

## Bonus
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Regressor to improve performance and document the impact of your changes.
